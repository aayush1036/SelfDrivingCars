# SelfDrivingCars 

This project aims to demonstrate the use of object detection in self driving cars. 

In this project, we have trained an object detection model on a sample from <a href="https://www.bdd100k.com/">BDD100k data</a>  with 20k images in train set, 2k images and validation set. 

We have demonstrated a use of heuristic function to determine the steering angle of the car. 

The dataset is available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayusmaanjain/bdd100k-for-self-driving-cars">Kaggle</a>
